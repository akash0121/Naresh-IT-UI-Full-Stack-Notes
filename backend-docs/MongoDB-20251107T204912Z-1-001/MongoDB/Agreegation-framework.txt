Aggregation Framework: The Aggregation Framework is used to Process data records and return computed results in a sequential manner. it is like performing sql operations such as GROUP BY,MAX,MIN,SUM,AVG etc.., but in a NOSQL, document oriented way.
   Here Aggregation PipeLines transform the documents as they pass through the stages producing a new result set which passes to the next stage as input

   syntax : db.collection.aggregate([{stage1:{}},{stage2:{}}...])
   The first stage recieves total collection's documents as input

   Most Used aggregate stages are : 
   i. $match: it is used to match or filter the documents with a condition. it is similar to SQL where

   Write a pipeline to filter only electronics category products
   db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}}])

   write a pipeline to filter prody\ucts whose price is greater than 300
   db.products.aggregate([{$match:{price:{$gt:300}}}])

   ii. $group :  it is used to group all the documents by one or more fields and perform operations such as sum,avg,max,min,count etc..,
   syntax: {
    $group:{
        "_id": "group_column",
        field : {accumulator:expression}
        ......
    }
   }

   write a pipeline to print total sales per each category
   db.products.aggregate([{$group:{"_id":"$category",totalSales:{$sum:"$cost"}}}])

   write an aggregate pipeline to find totalSales of electronics category
   db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}},{$group:{"_id":"$category",totalSales:{$sum:"$cost"}}}])

  write a pipeline to group all documents based on category and status
  db.products.aggregate([{$group:{"_id":{status:"$status",category:"$category"}}}])

  write a pipeline to print total number of products , their average per category. add their minimum and maximum price also per category
  db.products.aggregate([{$group:{"_id":"$category",total:{$count:{}},average:{$avg:"$cost"},maximumValue:{$max:"$cost"},minimumValue:{$min:"$cost"}}}])


  3. $project : it is used to shape or rename fields similar to SELECT in SQL
  it controls which fields to show, rename and format the data
  db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}},{$project:{_id:0,name:"$title",price:"$cost"}}])

  4. $sort,$limit,$skip: These are small stages which are used to sort, or limit or skip the documents

db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}},{$project:{_id:0,name:"$title",price:"$cost"}},{$sort:{price:1}},{$skip:1},{$limit:4},{$count:"total"}])
