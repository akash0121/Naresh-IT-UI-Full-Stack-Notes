Summary
- What is React?
- Why we need React?
- What are the challenges in modern Web development?
- How React is different from Angular?

Features of React:
1. It is component based.
		- Component comprises of markup, styles & logic.
		- Easy to reuse & extend. 
		- Easy maintain and test.
		- Faster in building applications.

2. It is modular
		- It is light weight
		- It uses less memory
		- It is faster in interactions. 
		
3. It uses “Virtual DOM”
		- Fast in rendering output. 
	
4. It uses One Way Binding 
		- Data binding is One Way implicitly.
		- You need to configure two way binding explicitly.




FAQ’s:
	1. What is DOM?
	A. It is hierarchy of elements in page. 

	2. How DOM is formed?
		
		Markup => Bytes => Chars => Tokens => Nodes [Elements] => DOM => Layout =>
		Render => Paint 

	3. What is shadow DOM?
	A. It is a hierarchy of elements in a component. [Shadow Root]

	4. What is virtual DOM?
	A. It is a copy of actual DOM in memory. 
		It makes the rendering fast. However it requires to update into actual DOM.

Issues with React:
	- Virtual DOM in memory 
	- Implicit one way binding
	- Lot of 3rd party integrations required. 
	- Lot of GAP’s.
